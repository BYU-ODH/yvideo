        <h2>How We Collect and Use Information</h2>

        <p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>

        <em>Information you provide us directly:</em>

        <p>
            You will access Y-video through the BYU Central Authentication System by providing your BYU NetID and password. We will use this information to query the BYU registration database through AIM in order to determine your class enrollments and allow you to access the media content that has been assigned to your classes. Your class enrollment is never displayed, but is used programmatically within the Service software. We will also retrieve your name and email address as found in the BYU registration records. We will only use your name and email in reports provided to your instructor(s), if requested, to verify completion of assignments.
        </p>

        <p>
            We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information on your use of the application and the content. We use this information to provide reports to instructors (if requested,) for anonymous research data collection, and to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.
        </p>

        <em>Analytics information:</em>

        <p>
            We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools and services, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any individual user.
        </p>
        
        <em>Cookies information:</em>
        
        <p>
            When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Y-Video help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. Full details can be found on our Cookie Policy.
        </p>

        <em>Log file information:</em>

        <p>
            Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.
        </p>
        
        <em>Clear gifs/web beacons information:</em>
        
        <p>
            When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. This information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.
        </p>
        
        <em>Device identifiers:</em>
        
        <p>
            When you access the Service by or through a mobile device (including but not limited to smart-phones or tablets), we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store one or more “device identifiers,” such as a universally unique identifier (“UUID”). Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device’s operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Y-Video. A device identifier may convey information to us about how you browse and use the Service. A device identifier may remain persistently on your device, to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Service. Some features of the Service may not function properly if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.
        </p>
        
        <em>Location data:</em>
        
        <p>
            When you access the Service by or through a mobile device, we may access, collect, monitor and/or remotely store “location data,” which may include GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the Service in order to improve Service reliability and how to best provide the content.
        </p>

        <em>Communications:</em>

        <p>
            We may use the information we collect or receive, such as your email address, to communicate directly with you only if necessary to provide you with assignment progress or completion information or in case of a particular problem you report to us. Your login, name, and email address will never be shared with anyone other than yourself, the instructor(s) that assigned you to use Y-Video, or possibly to a programmer who may be attempting to solve a problem that you are experiencing with our Service.
